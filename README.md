## About the Project:
The focus of this project was to create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM.Eat-Da-Burger is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
